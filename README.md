Weird ahh project I currently have in progress.

-Created using 'React' for HTML


-Tilesets from Itch.io 


-Pokemon sprites and animations from the PMD Sprite Repository


-Moral support from my friend, Colby Bobbitt



End goal is to essentially have an infinite floor arcade style PMD game with one dungeon (Maybe more, but that won't be for a long time (: ))
