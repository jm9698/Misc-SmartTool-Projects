Weird ahh project I currently have in progress.

-Created using 'React' for HTML
-Tilesets from Itch.io 
-Pokemon sprites and animations from the PMD Sprite Repository


End goal is to essentially have an infinite floor arcade style PMD game with one dungeon (Maybe more, but that won't be for a long time (: )
