Weird ahh project I currently have in progress.

-Created using 'React' for HTML
-Tilesets (uh, these don't work yet) from Itch.io (and maybe other free-use sources later)


End goal is to essentially have an infinite floor arcade style PMD game with one dungeon (Maybe more, but that won't be for a long time (: )
